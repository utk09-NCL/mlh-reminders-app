# MLH Reminders App

Built with React Native and Expo

To start:

1. Ensure you have Expo Go installed on you phone (Playstore/App Store)
2. Clone the repo
3. npm install (assuming you have node v20 and above, npm v10 and above)
4. npx expo start -c (starts expo without any cache)
5. You'll get a QR code:
   - scan it with Camera(iPhone) --> Open in Expo Go.
   - For Android, you can scan the QR code inside ExpoGo App itself
